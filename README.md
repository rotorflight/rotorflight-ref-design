# Rotorflight Flight Controller Reference Designs

This repository contains hardware _reference designs_ for Rotorflight.

## Design Considerations

There are many things to consider for a good design.

Please read the [Generic Design Requirements for RF](FC-Design-Requirements.md) first.


## Reference Designs

### STM32F7

There are currently two design variants for F7:

- [F7A](Reference-Design-F7A.md) for small FCs (7 pin rows wide)
- [F7C](Reference-Design-F7C.md) for large FCs (9 pin rows wide)

The following are deprecated, and should not be used for new designs.

- [F7B](Reference-Design-F7B.md) for large FCs (9 pin rows wide)
